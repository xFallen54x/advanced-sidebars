## Why use Advanced Sidebars?

-   Ever wanted to make your own sidebar like the ones on Servers but don't know were to Start well this pack will help you make that come true.
-   Easy to setup

## Getting started

- The titleraw is what you will most likely be using for your sidebar. It uses rawtext json formating. The three componets you will be focusing on in your commands for the sidebar are **text**, **score**, and **selector**. Your best bet for making the sidebar will be using functions instead of commands blocks it will be much easier in the end. 
 
- Command Example for creating your sidebar execute @a ~~~ ***titleraw @s {"rawtext":[{"text":"§l§eFallen §bSkyblock \n §7Name: §b"},{"selector":"@s"},{"text":"\n §7Balance: §a$},{"score":{"name":"@s","objective":"Balance"}}]}***
  - ## How it works
    - The **text** componet will display as any normal text, but for your sidebar you will need multiple lines. Thats what **\n** is for as shown in the command example above. Most people already know this but for those who don't know this symbol **§** will allow you to color or format your text on your sidebar.

    - The **selector** componet will display an entity's name. If you want to display the players name on their Sidebar you would use **@s**. (Will go more into detail later on, this could also be used to make suffixes for player scores. Example: ***10000 -> 10,000 or 10000 -> 10.00K***
